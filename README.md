# Multi-app Express server
Multi-app and multi-domain Express server to host multiple apps, and/or sites, while supporting a variety of combined technologies, under a single server. This means you can have a React app, Angular app, and Python/Flask app all operating at the same time, using only one port. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config
1. Cloning the repository and add your site and/or app folders into the `domain` folder.

2. Update `./config/domains.js` to match your project structure, and remove the example data.

* The `server.js` file utilizes `vhost` to allow multiple domains. You can reconfigure the examples to match your project needs, regex is used instead of string for the domain, allowing access for developing and testing on `localhost`.

* If your app or apps have their own express server, you can export the app, instead of listening to a port in the server file. Set its template property to `"app"` in `./config/domains.js`. The `setEngine()` function will expect your server file to be named `server.js` at the root of your projects folder in `domains`. For example, if your app was named `foo`, your `server.js` file should be found in the following path `./domains/foo/server.js`.

* Once the server has been started, your app can be found at, `<your-domain>.localhost:8080` in your browser.
